# Obrii SDR Live Roadmap

This document contains only current state and remaining work. Completed release
history belongs in CHANGELOG.md; detailed stability notes belong in
docs/release_stability_handoff.md.

## Current Baseline

The v5.1.0 release baseline provides:

1. First-class Fobos Standard and Agile receive paths, native RTL-SDR, and a
   hardware-tested native HackRF receive path. SoapySDR remains optional and
   experimental; bladeRF is hidden until real hardware is available.
2. Low-copy IQ publication, background FFT processing, FFTW multithreading,
   optional Vulkan/VkFFT, exact Hz-per-point FFT lengths, and optimized 2D/3D
   spectrum and waterfall rendering.
3. Native HackRF transmission laboratory with guarded arming and AM, FM, SSB,
   CW, FT8, audio-file, image, SSTV, and experimental video waveform sources.
4. Multi-VFO analysis over one shared wide FFT, channel mosaics, independently
   ranged mini spectra and waterfalls, and a selected audio monitor.
5. Spectrum-frame and IQ pre-trigger recording, synchronized replay,
   replay-side tuning/audio, 2D/3D views, and an area ruler.
6. Scientific spectrum tools: calibrated units, ENBW/RBW/VBW, overlap,
   detector modes, traces, markers, channel metrics, zero-span, masks,
   baseline comparison, triggers, pulse analysis, density/persistence,
   oscilloscope, constellation, eye diagram, synchronization analysis,
   dual-input HF analysis, and measurement sessions.
7. Frequency/amplitude calibration tables with interpolation, uncertainty,
   external-chain correction, and a guided live-spectrum calibration wizard.
8. IQ diagnostics for sequence/epoch/queue state, measured arrival rate,
   clipping, invalid samples, DC/IQ imbalance estimates, and visible waterfall
   rows for known internal queue drops or skipped visual snapshots.
9. A configurable audio-filter chain, graphical DSP board, saved DSP layouts,
   interface profiles, scanning/hunting tools, presets, network operation,
   serial NMEA/UBX GNSS, QTH mapping, and experimental digital decoders.

## Release-Grade Boundaries

Usable but still requiring explicit qualification:

1. Absolute dBm/dBuV/uV accuracy is only as good as the user's generator,
   attenuator, cables, gain state, and calibration table. The wizard automates
   measurement; it does not create traceability.
2. HackRF TX must be tested into a dummy load with appropriate attenuation and
   local legal limits. Fobos hardware remains receive-only.
3. Vulkan/VkFFT performance varies by GPU, driver, FFT length, and platform.
   Auto and CPU fallback must remain available.
4. Known internal IQ discontinuities are marked. A true USB/driver loss marker
   still depends on each backend exposing trustworthy transfer-loss data.

Experimental, not a stable-release claim:

1. DMR voice/metadata, DSD-neo, GopherTrunk, and authorized ARC4/AES key paths.
2. SDR-only GNSS acquisition and navigation decoding.
3. FPV/ATV/digital-video decoding beyond current laboratory scaffolding.
4. SoapySDR across untested hardware and all bladeRF support.

## Remaining Priorities

### P0: Stability And Release Hygiene

1. Keep start/stop/close operations bounded and off the UI thread where device
   APIs permit it.
2. Keep normal logging quiet; detailed FFT, retune, transport, GNSS, and DMR
   diagnostics remain behind the logging option.
3. Preserve the Fobos-specific hot path. Generic integrations must not insert
   adapters, schedulers, or copies into its callback-to-IQ-buffer path.
4. Continue splitting cold UI/feature glue out of main.cpp without changing
   live receive semantics.
5. Build and smoke-test Windows and Raspberry source before each public tag.

### P1: Physical Validation

1. Validate calibration across receiver, input, sample-rate, gain, and
   frequency combinations with a known generator and attenuator.
2. Validate HackRF RX controls and TX modes on real hardware, including
   underrun reporting, guard limits, and dummy-load tests.
3. Reproduce any remaining Fobos Agile startup shift or shutdown delay with
   current firmware and libraries before changing the proven startup sequence.
4. Profile Raspberry audio continuity while optional scientific windows,
   multi-VFO views, and high FFT lengths are active.

### P2: Architecture Extensions

1. Add GNU Radio interoperability as an optional external bridge described in
   docs/gnu_radio_compatibility.md. Do not link GNU Radio into the core app.
2. If simultaneous independent channel demodulators/recorders become necessary,
   implement a measured polyphase filter-bank output stage. The current
   Multi-VFO path deliberately shares one FFT and one proven audio monitor.
3. Add backend-specific USB/driver discontinuity counters only where the
   underlying API can report them reliably.
4. Add HDF5 only when a real large-series workflow justifies the runtime and
   packaging cost. CSV, JSON, SigMF, raw IQ, and spectrum-frame files remain
   the portable baseline.

### P3: Deferred Signal Work

1. Build deterministic offline DMR fixtures before further live AMBE/privacy
   tuning.
2. Compare saved GNSS IQ against a mature reference receiver before changing
   acquisition thresholds or adding more constellations.
3. Resume video-decoder work only with repeatable captures and expected output.
4. Revisit multi-receiver display and synchronization after one-receiver
   operation remains stable on Raspberry-class hardware.

## DSP Board Coverage

The DSP board has direct blocks or launchers for receiver/network/playback
sources, tuning, channel filtering, resampling, FFT, demodulation, every audio
filter stage, audio output, record/replay, TX, scanning/hunters, Multi-VFO,
2D/3D displays, digital text/image/audio/video, GNSS/QTH, presets,
calibration, GPIO, backend-specific Fobos/HackRF tools, and application
settings.

Dedicated measurement blocks now open the exact tool for interference/comb
analysis, statistics, IQ diagnostics, dual-input HF analysis, the scientific
analyzer, density, selected-band density, masks/baseline, pulse analysis, and
measurement sessions. Oscilloscope, constellation, eye diagram, digital
synchronization, VFO spectrum, and VFO waterfall also have self-contained
visual blocks.

The board is a live control and visualization surface, not yet an arbitrary
IQ graph scheduler. Connections document intended flow; only implemented
blocks alter the real processing path. This boundary prevents a visual layout
from silently adding copies or latency to the Fobos hot path.

## Release Checklist

1. Build Windows x64 and smoke-test the staged release/bin directory.
2. Package Raspberry/Linux source and verify build/run/dependency scripts.
3. Do not publish Android unless it was rebuilt and tested on its Android
   development machine.
4. Parse both translation JSON files and inspect new English/Ukrainian labels.
5. Exclude settings, logs, screenshots, tokens, map keys, DMR keys, GNSS raw
   logs, coordinates, device serials, and real IQ/audio/video captures.
6. Preserve user settings and presets during upgrades; document import/export.
7. Verify optional third-party binaries and notices are complete and licensed.

## Privacy Rules

1. ObriiSDR.ini and legacy FobosAPP.ini are always local user data.
2. Exact GNSS coordinates, QTH markers, map keys, DMR keys, tokens, logs, and
   recordings must never enter release archives or commits.
3. Diagnostic logs should avoid exact coordinates unless the user explicitly
   exports them.
4. Generated reports should identify whether personal location or receiver
   serial metadata is included before export.
